The following problem comes from Douglas Hofstadter's book \emph{GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach}~\cite{hofstadter79}.
Take the time to try to solve this problem yourself.
The problem concerns strings of characters.
The only characters allowed/available are M, U and I.

\subsubsection*{Question}
You start with the string MI and the goal is to use the four rules below to convert it into the string MU.
In the rules, the letter x denotes any string.
You can use the rules any number of times and in any order, just so long as you get to MU~\cite{muwikipedia}.

\begin{tabular}{rlll}

 & Rule & Example & Explanation  \\
\midrule
1 &	xI to xIU & MI	to	MIU & Append U to the end of a string ending in I. \\
2 &	Mx to Mxx & MIU	to	MIUIU & Double the string after the M. \\
3 &	xIIIy to xUy & MUIIIU	to	MUUU & Replace any III with a U. \\
4 &	xUUy to xy & MUUU	to	MU & Remove any UU. \\
